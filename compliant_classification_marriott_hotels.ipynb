We have used them for vacation and my husband drives a truck so on the fly it is super easy if he needs a room for the night to see what is available and use our points.

I had talked to several front desk staff members prior to our stay and asked about room types. Carmen and Lisa were so nice and accommodating. Most reviews on Trip Advisor were positive and we looked forward to our first stay there. When we arrived on Friday, April 5, Pam, the manager, greeted us. WOW! She has the brightest smile and the personality to go with it! She was working at the hotel for all five days of our stay. She was always smiling, and even when things got stressful at the front desk, she was pleasant. Haley is another staff member who is at the top of our list of people to comment on. She had a smile for every person! Housekeeping staff were also professional and pleasant. We had a King Suite, which is one of the nicest room types that we have stayed in.\n",

At the end of the day, they won't pay, but I am supposed to be OK with that because I got 1000 free bonvoy points. It may as well be monopoly money because I have no use for them. I am appalled that customer service for such a large corporation can get away with treating customers in such a way. They have lost my business and I will tell all of my friends and family to never stay at a Marriott hotel. We would've been better off staying at the Airbnb that was 40 dollars cheaper.

I just attended a conference, the NACo 2024 (National Association of Counties), where everyone else paid $185/night, and I'm being charged over $500/night. Prior to the conference, I switched over from the Hilton when I needed to extend the stay and stay more days for my team’s presentation. The slots at the hotels were filling up and the front desk person assured me that if I just booked we could reconcile the rate retroactively. What a mistake to trust! Not only is over $500/night egregious in comparison to the rate hundreds of others had, but it is not good for me when I have to submit this stay for Court approval. It will hit the news.\n",

After experiencing how the chain processes their transactions against a customers card, one to which they deny but has been verified with my bank. They send an authorization request to your bank upon check in and instead of using that same authorization number to process the charges when you check out, they submit a second authorization request to your bank for the final charges. Resulting in duplicate amount of charges frozen on your account,( if using a debit/bank card) until your bank receives the charges to one if the two authorizations they gave to the hotel. Now, I have experienced the hotel moving my reservation which was booked in advance and charging me the rate of the day which was $800 more than the rate originally booked.\n",

The 1 was just a Marriott, everything in the bathroom was filthy, with mold & mildew growing in shower & sink area, the air conditioner/heat had to be cleaned after I pointed out the thick layer of filth. The other was actually their Westin brand & during the pandemic & yet, people without masks in the lobby, the room was not clean, the alarm clock was broken & filthy!! And it took 40-60 min (after 10pm) to get someone to bring a replacement alarm clock for me & a blanket, since they had none.

      "Review: We stayed at Marriott in Covington, KY over the 4th of July 2024. Hotel went through renovations and was a disappointment. Floors were dirty and sticky, no hooks in bathroom to hang clothes or towels and no exhaust fan. Lighting in bathroom was very dim with no way of making it brighter. You have to pay for parking each time you leave the parking garage. That adds up quickly if you come and go a few times. Strongly feel the hotel should provide free parking since they charge enough for the rooms. The hotel only had 1 restaurant (other one closed after renovations) and did not provide a good selection. Food was decent but overpriced. Had to have bed mattress replaced due to feeling the springs. Took over 2 hrs for this to be swapped out. Don't feel we'll be staying at any Marriott's anytime soon.\n",
